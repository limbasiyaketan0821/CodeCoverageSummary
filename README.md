# Code Coverage Summary

A GitHub Action that reads Cobertura format code coverage files from your test suite and outputs a text or markdown summary. This summary can then be posted as a Pull Request comment, included in Release Notes, etc by another action to give you an immediate insight into the health of your code without using a third-party site.

Code Coverage Summary was designed for use with [Coverlet](https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet) and .Net but it should work with any test framework that outputs coverage in Cobertura format.

## Inputs

#### `files`
**Required**

Code coverage files to analyse and compare. Please enter your files comma separated. First file should be Base file. Ex. BaseBranchCoverage.xml,CurrentBranchCoverage.xml
Note: Coverlet creates the coverage file in a random named directory (guid) so you need to copy it to a predictable path before running this Action, see the [.Net 5 Workflow Example](#net-5-workflow-example) below.

#### `badge`

Include a badge reporting the Line Rate coverage in the output using [shields.io](https://shields.io/) - `true` or `false` (default).

If the overall Line Rate is less than 50% the badge will be red, if it is 50% - 74% it will be yellow and if it is 75% or over it will be green. 

#### `format`

Output Format - `markdown` or `text` (default).

#### `output`

Output Type - `console` (default), `file` or `both`.

`console` will output the coverage summary to the GitHub Action log.

`file` will output the coverage summary to `code-coverage-results.txt` for text or `code-coverage-results.md` for markdown format in the workflow's working directory.

`both` will output the coverage summary to the Action log and a file as above.

## Outputs

#### Text Example
```
https://img.shields.io/badge/Code%20Coverage-77%25-success?style=flat
Line Rate = 77%, Lines Covered = 1107 / 1433
Branch Rate = 60%, Branches Covered = 321 / 532
Complexity = 917
Company.Example: Line Rate = 78%, Branch Rate = 60%, Complexity = 906
Company.Example.Library: Line Rate = 27%, Branch Rate = 100%, Complexity = 11
```
